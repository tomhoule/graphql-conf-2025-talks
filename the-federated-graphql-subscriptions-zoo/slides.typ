== Subscriptions are special... in GraphQL

#quote(attribution: link("https://spec.graphql.org/draft/#sec-Type-Name-Introspection")[GraphQL spec (draft)])[
  GraphQL supports type name introspection within any selection set in an operation, with the single exception of selections at the root of a subscription operation.

#quote(attribution: link("https://spec.graphql.org/draft/#sel-HALPJDDHBCBJ4uR")[GraphQL spec (draft)])[
  Subscription operations must have exactly one root field.

  To enable us to determine this without access to runtime variables, we must forbid the \@skip and \@include directives in the root selection set.

   While each subscription must have exactly one root field, a document may contain any number of operations, each of which may contain different root fields. When executed, a document containing multiple subscription operations must provide the operation name as described in GetOperation().

{"name":"Furbies (12 pack)"}

```

== The problems with Federated Subscriptions

- Lack of transport standardisation has led to fragmentation:
  - WebSockets (HTTP/1.1)
    - Subprotocols with protocol negotiation
      ```
      Sec-WebSocket-Version: 13
      Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: graphql-ws, graphql-transport-ws
      ```
    - Init payloads are not headers
    // you have to think about just like header forwarding, but separate, and more complicated with the mappings
  - SSE (HTTP/2 and 3)
  - Multipart
- One connection between the Gateway and the relevant subgraph per subscribed client, even when they all subscribe to the same events
- Multi-protocol subscriptions

== Multi-protocol subscriptions

- üñäÔ∏è Client --- üçç-> Gateway --- üçé-> üñäÔ∏è Subgraph

#pause

- At each step, one of
  - SSE,
  - WebSockets
    - `subscriptions-transport-ws`
    - `graphql-ws` / `graphql-transport-ws`
- And different handshake shapes between each!
  - Headers vs websocket init payload shapes mismatch
  // you have to think about just like header forwarding, but separate, and more complicated with the mappings
  // and case sensitivity!

== Event queue to gateway

- The idea: the gateway talks to a message queue (Kafka, NATS, ...), not the subgraphs directly
- Two implementations

  - #link("https://grafbase.com/docs/extensions")[Grafbase extensions]

== EDFS

#block[
#set text(size: 16pt)
```graphql
input edfs__NatsStreamConfiguration {
    consumerInactiveThreshold: Int! = 30
    consumerName: String!
    streamName: String!
}

type PublishEventResult {
    success: Boolean!
}

type Query {
    employeeFromEvent(id: ID!): Employee! @edfs__natsRequest(subject: "getEmployee.{{ args.id }}")
}

input UpdateEmployeeInput {
    name: String
    email: String
}

type Mutation {
    updateEmployee(id: ID!, update: UpdateEmployeeInput!): PublishEventResult! @edfs__natsPublish(subject: "updateEmployee.{{ args.id }}")
}

type Subscription {
    employeeUpdated(employeeID: ID!): Employee! @edfs__natsSubscribe(subjects: ["employeeUpdated.{{ args.employeeID }}"])
}

type Employee @key(fields: "id", resolvable: false) {
  id: Int! @external
}
```
]

== Grafbase extensions

TODO

== Advantages of an extensions-based approach compared to EDFS

- Arbitrary data formats for the messages (not only JSON)
- Customizable and extensible without touching the Gateway. You can write extensions for other pub/sub systems (Kinesis, etc.).
- More powerful filters (`jq` expression language)
- By convention, configuration is usually in your Gateway configuration, not expressed in your subgraph's GraphQL schemas

== Takeaways

#pause

- Federated GraphQL subscriptions require some thinking and planning.

#pause

- Pros of traditional federated subscriptions
  - Federate existing GraphQL subgraphs, no need to modify them
  - Subscription fields are managed directly in your subgraphs, next to your other logic

#pause

- Pros of subscriptions offloaded to a message queue
  - Stream deduplication
  - Non-GraphQL services can publish to subjects directly
  - Depends on setup, but usually higher performance with less memory usage
