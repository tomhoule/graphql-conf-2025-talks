== Subscriptions are special... in GraphQL

#quote(attribution: link("https://spec.graphql.org/draft/#sec-Type-Name-Introspection")[GraphQL spec (draft)])[
  GraphQL supports type name introspection within any selection set in an operation, with the single exception of selections at the root of a subscription operation.

  Subscription operations must have exactly one root field.

  To enable us to determine this without access to runtime variables, we must forbid the \@skip and \@include directives in the root selection set.

   While each subscription must have exactly one root field, a document may contain any number of operations, each of which may contain different root fields. When executed, a document containing multiple subscription operations must provide the operation name as described in GetOperation().

== The problems with Federated Subscriptions

- Lack of transport standardisation has led to fragmentation:
  - WebSockets (HTTP/1.1)
  - SSE (HTTP/2 and 3)
- Stateful connections impose extra burden on the subgraphs and the gateway
- Connection loss is both more likely and harder to handle
- One connection between the Gateway and the relevant subgraph per subscribed client, even when they all subscribe to the same events
- Multi-protocol subscriptions

== Multi-protocol subscriptions

- üñäÔ∏è Client --- üçç-> Gateway --- üçé-> üñäÔ∏è Subgraph

#pause

- At each step, one of
  - SSE,
  - WebSockets
    - `subscriptions-transport-ws`
    - `graphql-ws` / `graphql-transport-ws`
- And different handshake shapes between each!
  - Headers vs init payload formats
  // you have to think about just like header forwarding, but separate, and more complicated with the mappings

== Event queue to gateway

== Takeaways

- Pros of traditional federated subscriptions
  - Federate existing GraphQL subgraphs, no need to modify them
  - Subscription fields are managed directly in your subgraphs, next to your other logic

#pause

- Pros of subscriptions offloaded to a message queue
  - Stream deduplication
  - Non-GraphQL services can publish to subjects directly
